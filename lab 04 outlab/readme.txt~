	commit message- "Pearson based sorting finished"

		This is same as the above because the commit master branch's tip was pointing to is the ancestor of pearson branch.So merging
	just fast forwards master branch's tip.

Task_A3:
		Euclidean distances are used when the actual differences are important.But when we want to extract the similarity between data, 
	is wiser to use pearson coefficient than euclidean distance.Also pearson coefficient is robust to multiplication with a constant or 
	addition of a constant(to all the data values).


Task_B1:
	commit message- "First commit"
	commit number- 3abbe6a770eecb1dcbd3aa6a29fd2920d76dd011

Task_B2:
		No, it doesn't work for complex numbers because sum function takes only list of integers or floats as arguments so whenever we
	try to use the sum function for types other than integers,float such as complex numbers,strings etc it gives TypeError:unsupported operand type.

Task_B3:
		We got a merge conflict because same region of the file was commited in both the master and the representation branches after
	branching. Once we resolved the conflict both the functions are working fine

Task_B4:
		Yes, there will be a conflict because same region of the file was commited in both the master and the electricity! branch after 
	branching.So git fails to merge the branches and asks the user to resolve the conflict manually

citations: none

reflection essay:
------------------
		Using git was very interesting. The fact that changes the files in the working diectory whenever we checkout commits or branches 
	is very intriguing.We also used 'commit amend' option to overwrite the latest commit.

		We realised that we need to use 'python3 filename.py' and not 'python filename.py'.Very unfortunately, we were late. We used
	'python filename.py' during inlab.Please consider this.
