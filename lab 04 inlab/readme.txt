extra credits - 1)We could not apppend elements to a tuple because tuples are immutable datatypes and therefore we cannot append elements to tuples

		        2)It is not a contradiction because elements are not being appended directly to tuple but a mutable data type like lists,dictionaries,sets which is an element of the tuple in which case that can be individually accessed and changed.
